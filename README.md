# Epidemic Model for COVIDAnalytics Research Effort

The repository contains code for a Mathematica implementation of the epidemiological model utilized in the research effort of our group called COVIDAnalytics, with projections on the website:

http://www.covidanalytics.io/

The notebook code was written with Mathematica 12.1 but should work with any version greater than 10.0.

We also included a python implementation using scipy.solve_ivp. It has been tested on Python 3.7.

Documentation is contained in the pdf document: DELPHI_Explainer.

Code created by Michael Lingzhi Li, Hamza Tazi Bouardi, and Omar Skali Lami.
