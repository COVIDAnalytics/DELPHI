# Epidemic Model for COVIDAnalytics Research Effort

The repository contains code for a Mathematica implementation of the epidemiological model utilized in the research effort of our group called COVIDAnalytics, with projections on the website:

http://www.covidanalytics.io/

The notebook code was written with Mathematica 12.1 but should work with any version greater than 10.0.

We also included a python implementation using scipy.solve_ivp in the file DELPHI_model.py. It has been tested on Python 3.7. We are currently transitioning to a newer model that takes care of reopening policies, and there would be a new file for that implementation soon. The documentation would also be updated. 

Documentation is contained in the pdf document: DELPHI_Explainer.

Code created by Michael Lingzhi Li, Hamza Tazi Bouardi, and Omar Skali Lami.
