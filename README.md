# Epidemic Model for COVIDAnalytics Research Effort

The repository contains code for a Mathematica implementation of the epidemiological model utilized in the research effort of our group called COVIDAnalytics, with projections on the website:

http://www.covidanalytics.io/

The code was written with Mathematica 12.1 but should work with any version greater than 10.0.

Documentation would be provided soon.
